# Unifi 16 Port Switch PoE Lite

My network is powered by a [Unifi switch](https://eu.store.ui.com/eu/en/products/usw-lite-16-poe). It's managed by the [[Unifi]] service. It provides power to my [Raspberry Pi 4b](Raspberry%20Pi%204b.md)s and my Unifi Access Point. There are some bonded interfaces for [dionysus](dionysus).
