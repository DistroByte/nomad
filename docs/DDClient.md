[Ddclient](https://ddclient.net/) updates dynamic DNS entries for accounts on a wide range of dynamic DNS services.

As I run all my services at home, that IP address is subject to change at the whim of my ISP, thus this service allows me to update the DNS records on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) to match those IP address changes.

It is deployed with the [ddclient](../jobs/ddclient.hcl) job and configured with a config file like below.

```ini
# Configuration file for ddclient generated by debconf
#
# /etc/ddclient.conf

daemon=1800
use=web
web=api.ipify.org/
ssl=yes

protocol=cloudflare
ssl=yes
server=api.cloudflare.com/client/v4
login=<email address>
password=<api key>
