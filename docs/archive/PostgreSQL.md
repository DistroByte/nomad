[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an SQL type database, much like MySQL. It has replication abilities and is widely supported.

PostgreSQL is deployed with the [postgresql](../jobs/postgresql/postgresql.hcl) job and backed up with the [postgresql-backup](../jobs/postgresql/postgresql-backup.hcl) job.
