title: Raspberry Pi 4b
---

I have 4 Raspberry Pi Model 4bs in my homelab. They are all running the 64bit version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/). Two of them have 2GB of RAM, 2 have 8GB of RAM. All 4 are PoE powered via my [Unifi 16 Port Switch PoE Lite](Unifi%2016%20Port%20Switch%20PoE%20Lite.md). They're racked in a [Uctronics SSD Cluster Case](https://thepihut.com/products/ssd-cluster-case-for-raspberry-pi).

## Specifications
