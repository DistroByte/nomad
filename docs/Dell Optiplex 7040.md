title: Dell Optiplex 7040
---

I have two Dell Optiplex 7040 Micros in my homelab. They're both running Debian 12 and both have 8GB of RAM. As they're x86 hosts, they perform the bulk of my compute heavy tasks.

## Specifications

| Hardware | Specification  |
| -------- | -------------- |
| CPU      | Intel i5-6500T |
| RAM      | 8GB            |

## Notes

Press `F2` to enter the BIOS.
