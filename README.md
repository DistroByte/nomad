# Nomad

This repo serves as an offsite store of my nomad job specs, useful ansible playbooks and my documentation.

By keeping my documentation beside my job files and ansible playbooks, I hope to keep the documentation closer to the real state of my homelab.

## Docs

For more in-depth docs on my homelab, see [docs/](docs/).

## Nomad jobs

See the [jobs/](jobs/) directory.

## Ansible

See the [ansible](ansible/) directory.
